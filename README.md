## Who am I?
üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Osman Khan aka @Oztheproblem. I'm excited and proud to be a [@makersacademy](https://github.com/makersacademy) student who joined in Apirl '23. I will be graduating by July '23 and will be a Software Developer with transferable skills from Education, Project Management and Health & Wellbeing. In addition to my Technical skills are my 'Soft Skills', which are my greatest strengths. I am eager to learn and excel in my field. Despite my lack of experience in Software Development, I am determined and have self-studied Front End, AWS, Azure, Agile and Scrum methodologies.

Having taught Health Sciences in Dubai for five years and experienced the transformative power of technology in the classroom, I am now eager to make a career transition to software development. I have always had a natural affinity for technology and enjoy working in collaborative environments, making the transition to software development a natural fit for me. I am also interested in Cloud, Data and DevOps.
