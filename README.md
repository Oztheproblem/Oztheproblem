A Software Developer with transferable skills from Education, Project Management and Health & Wellbeing, my 'Soft Skills' are my greatest strength. I am eager to learn and excel in my field. Despite my lack of experience in Software Development, I am determined and have self-studied Front End, AWS, Azure, Agile and Scrum methodologies.

I am excited and proud to be a  [@makersacademy](https://github.com/makersacademy) student who joined in Apirl '23.
